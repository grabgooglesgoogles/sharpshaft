 Sharpshaft (https://sharpshaft.com) is an online resource all about crossbows and hunting.
 
 It covers a large range of topics, from the best products and equipment for shooting practice or hunting, to informational content on the state of crossbow use and hunting in general.
 
 Just some (but not all) of the equipment it reviews are crossbows, scopes, arrows & bolts, broadheads, climbing tree stands, hang on tree stands, and safety harnesses.
 
 Recently they published an article on the amount of money spent on hunting annually in the US, taking a look at published government data for 2016.
